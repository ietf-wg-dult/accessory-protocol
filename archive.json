This is another topic that is important to engage with victim advocacy groups on, for their expertise.",

It\u2019s my understanding that those identifiers are a critical part of the physical evidence in law enforcement response to unwanted tracking related calls from victims, and in the prosecution of such cases. Recommend we discuss this issue with victim advocacy groups, and consider requiring all identifiers to be printed on the physical device.",

In section 3.15. Pairing registry, how would the registry data be validated (prepaid SIM, gmail address)? Who would be responsible for managing the personal data with respect to GDPR? While many countries now require formal identification, many do not, leaving the ability to register anonymously available. Recording the IMEI of the owner's device could be valid too. Logging biometric data during registration, possibly with a government-issued identification document could also be considered.\r\n\r\n@bledvina:\r\n\r\nFor the current internet draft the validation of the pairing data would be up to the party doing the accessory pairing.\r\n\r\nThis topic will likely be revisited as part of the IETF DULT WG, so tagging this with the appropriate label\r\n",
