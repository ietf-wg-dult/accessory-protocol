This is another topic that is important to engage with victim advocacy groups on, for their expertise.",

It\u2019s my understanding that those identifiers are a critical part of the physical evidence in law enforcement response to unwanted tracking related calls from victims, and in the prosecution of such cases.

          "body": "While there can be a small privacy effect in having a printed serial number, it seems strongly outweighed by the risk of unwanted tracking that couldn't be easily reported. In particular, a rotating identifier electronically accessible via NFC or similar doesn't work for the person who finds an unwanted tracker and smashes it and then still needs the ability to report to law enforcement. While trackers can and should provide disablement instructions, we should anticipate that smashing the device to disable it will be a common action taken for protection.\r\n\r\nBecause an etched serial number can be scratched out, it seems like there are reasons to include near-field electronic access as well as printed form, and, per dkg, maybe we should recommend that the printed form also be printed internally on the device.",

In section 3.15. Pairing registry, how would the registry data be validated (prepaid SIM, gmail address)? Who would be responsible for managing the personal data with respect to GDPR? While many countries now require formal identification, many do not, leaving the ability to register anonymously available. Recording the IMEI of the owner's device could be valid too. Logging biometric data during registration, possibly with a government-issued identification document could also be considered.\r\n\r\n@bledvina:\r\n\r\nFor the current internet draft the validation of the pairing data would be up to the party doing the accessory pairing.\r\n\r\nThis topic will likely be revisited as part of the IETF DULT WG, so tagging this with the appropriate label\r\n",
